# KillRealGameEngine

there is just some piece of pet project, you can find a lot of draft and junk code here, but i will fix module after finishing working on it

# GOALS  

- [x] Entity Component System with Data Oriented Design
- [x] OpenGL Scene Rendering  
- [x] 3d models loading
- [x] imgui
- [x] deferred shading
- [x] directional ortho light shadows
- [ ] perspective ortho light
- [ ] point light
- [ ] sky (don't like current realisation) 
- [ ] invent engine name (KillReallGameEngine not bad, but is the best?)
- [x] frustum culling
- [ ] depth culling
- [x] LOD
- [ ] LOD depending on screen space size instead distane
- [ ] batcher (existing just draft)
- [ ] own 3d math module
- [ ] custom allocator for game data (models, sprites etc)
- [x] custom allocator for ECS
- [ ] entities actions
- [ ] physics engine (want my own)
- [ ] ability to draw object via custom shader which ok with deferred shading
- [ ] precompile models format and faster models loading in game
- [ ] own gui (imgui good, but not very fast)
- [ ] add specular and other maps to the models
- [ ] skeleton animation
- [ ] (possible some 3d tools for converting normals in needed for me way)
- [ ] 3d objects visual redactor utils
- [ ] drag and drop
- [ ] choose object by click
- [ ] outlines
- [ ] multithread integration, first of all add ability to update systems in parallel
- [ ] Shadows (don't like how it looks now, but it works)
- [ ] SSAO(current algorithm is not fast enough, and have some glitches while fast moving)
- [ ] SSR
- [x] HDR
- [ ] volumetric FOG
- [x] logs
- [ ] logs to file
- [ ] volumetric clouds with shadows
- [ ] dynamic meshes
- [ ] vulkan 
- [ ] directx
- [ ] ray tracing

I will add new goals as soon as find somenew
